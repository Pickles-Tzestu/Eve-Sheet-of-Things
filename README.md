# Eve-Sheet-of-Things
Happy to announce the release the publicly available Pickle's EveOnline Sheet of Things! Currently in version 1.2! Please find the latest version here: [https://github.com/Pickles-Tzestu/Eve-Sheet-of-Things/blob/main/Pickle's%20EveOnline%20Sheet%20of%20Things%20V1.1.5.xlsx](https://github.com/Pickles-Tzestu/Eve-Sheet-of-Things/blob/main/Pickle's%20EveOnline%20Sheet%20of%20Things%20V1.2.xlsx)

Please feel free to upgrade, modify, make better to fit your needs and goals in EVE!

Some assembly required, You will need the Eve Online Excel Addon and you will need to log into your character for this to work. Instructions on how to install and log in can be found here: https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/8165207770524-EVE-Online-Excel-Add-in
you will also need to add your own blueprints to the blueprints tabs. I have left some examples. its probably going to take you a couple cycles to get done but once you have added all of your available bp's you will be able to see universe wide margins across all of your bp's and will know what to make when! (currently there is no good way to pull this data. I'm hoping that the BP related commands are improved in the future and updated versions of the document will be released.)
The item price lookup is powered by columns A-C, the information for those columns is found here: https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/latest/ and searching invTypes.csv. from there I normally past in the updated columns and update the "FullList" Range, the "items2" range will automatically update.

Current Functionality:
Multiple Character Login supported
Wallet, Industry, Market Order tracking for Characters.
Item price lookup with optional region and station selections!
Character asset lookup (this was done to gather Blueprint ID's) 
Tabs to view BP manufacturing percentages and prices
